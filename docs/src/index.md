# Water Quantity and Quality Monitoring Platform

A decision-support platform for near real-time monitoring of water surface area and quality in South Africa using remote sensing and in-situ data.

## Introduction

Water resources are under threat due to climate change, pollution, and increased demand. This project provides a robust, scalable solution to track water quality and quantity over time using satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat), geospatial processing, and modern backend frameworks like Django and Celery.

The platform features:
- Automatic and semi-automatic monthly water quality and quantity mapping
- Time-series analytics and forecasting of eutrophication spread
- Downloadable raster outputs, web map views, and structured reports

## Key Concepts

A **project** represents a specific water body or region being monitored.

**Context layers** provide essential geospatial context such as administrative boundaries, land cover, or rainfall.

**Indicators** are derived from satellite indices like:
- AWEI (Automated Water Extraction Index)
- NDTI (Normalized Difference Turbidity Index)
- NDCI (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index)
- SABI (Surface Algal Bloom Index)


### Disclaimer

### Purpose

To support evidence-based decisions around water resources through automated monitoring tools and EO-based analytics.

### Scope of Project

- Monthly index computation (AWEI, NDTI, NDCI, SABI)
- Integration of in-situ and satellite data
- API access to analysis results
- Report generation in PDF and TIFF formats
- Dockerized deployment with cloud support
